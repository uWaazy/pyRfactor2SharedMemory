Python mapping of The Iron Wolf's rF2 Shared Memory Plugin interface for rFactor 2

This library is based on:
- rFactor 2 InternalsPlugin header file by S397.
- The Iron Wolf's rF2 Shared Memory Plugin: https://github.com/TheIronWolfModding/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin

Type hints & annotation:
- Annotate "ctypes type" as "Python type" according to table from:
